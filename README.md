  ## Description
  For this assignment, you'll create a employee directory with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.
  
   ## User Story
  As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
  Given a table of random users generated from the Random User API, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.
The user should be able to:


Sort the table by at least one category


Filter the users by at least one property.
